Thanks for sharing your code! You've done a great job structuring your personal portfolio using semantic HTML. Here's a detailed review with suggestions to help you polish and improve it further:

---

## ‚úÖ What You Did Well

- **Semantic Structure**: Great use of `<header>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<figure>`, and `<footer>`.
- **Navigation**: Clear and organized `<nav>` with list items.
- **Project Showcase**: Each project is wrapped in `<article>`, which is perfect.
- **Form Usage**: You‚Äôve included a contact form with labels and input types.
- **Visuals**: Use of images and `figcaption` adds personality and clarity.

## üõ†Ô∏è Suggestions for Improvement

### 1. **Accessibility & Best Practices**

- **Missing `alt` attributes**:
  - Add `alt` text to all images for screen readers.
    ```html
    <img src="..." alt="Profile icon" />
    ```
- **Navigation links**:
  - Wrap list items in anchor tags for actual navigation.
    ```html
    <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
    ```

### 2. **Form Corrections**

- **Incorrect `required` usage**:
  - `required="name"` is invalid. Use `required` alone.
    ```html
    <input type="text" id="name" name="name" required />
    ```
- **Missing `id` attributes**:
  - Labels should match input `id`s for accessibility.
    ```html
    <label for="email">Email Id</label>
    <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required />
    ```

### 3. **Content & Grammar**

- **Typos**:
  - "Expereince" ‚Üí "Experience"
  - "resereved" ‚Üí "reserved"
  - "Poject Image" ‚Üí "Project Image"
- **Clarity in descriptions**:
  - Some project descriptions are a bit repetitive. Try tightening the language for clarity.

### 4. **Footer & Social Links**

- **Social links should be inside `<footer>`**:
  ```html
  <footer>
    <p>Made with ‚ù§Ô∏è All rights reserved to Tim</p>
    <a href="https://www.instagram.com">Instagram</a>
    <a href="https://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>
  </footer>
  ```
- **Use full URLs**: Add `https://` to avoid broken links.

### 5. **HTML Validation**

Run your code through [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to catch minor syntax issues.

## üåü Bonus Suggestions (Optional)

- Add `id` attributes to each section for anchor navigation.
- Use `<main>` to wrap all primary content between `<header>` and `<footer>`.
- Consider grouping form fields with `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` for better structure.
