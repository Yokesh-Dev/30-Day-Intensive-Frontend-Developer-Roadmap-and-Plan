  <!-- The lang attribute specifies the language of the element's content. Common
  examples are "en" for English,"es" for Spanish, "fr" for French and so on-->

The <html lang="en"> tag defines the document to be in English.
The <head> section contains metadata and the title of the webpage, which appears in the browser's title bar.
The <body> section contains the content that will be displayed on the webpage.
